I have not contribute anything to my family as an software engineer.\n
Therefore, my boss(wife) would like to listen to bunch of Youtube musics easily and continuously on her new smart phone, without any user interaction.\n
So, I have been programming in my spare time.\n
Here is my lovely wife. Thank to my wife with my heart.
